# SelectionTags

This extension for Qliksense creates an object, showing the selected fields as tags. It doesnt need any dimension or measure, because it uses the selected fields.
The extension works the same way as normal Qliksense selection, so, if you deselect a field the other dependent fields will be deselected too.
