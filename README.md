# SelectionTags

This extension for Qliksense creates an object, showing the selected fields as tags. It doesnt need any dimension or measure, because it uses the selected fields.
The extension works the same way as normal Qliksense selection, so, if you deselect a field the other dependent fields will be deselected too.

- V1.0: Now you can configure the color by field! Add Item in the Line Settings; Configure the Field Name (case sensitive) as the name of the dimension; Select background and font color for the tags!

- V1.1: Now you can define the colors (background and font) for each tag using an hexadecimal (#FFFFFF) color.

- V1.2: Field Label created: This option add an alias for the dimension if needed.
